# Example docker for redmine git hosting

This is a working example for redmine git hosting. Just clone this
repo, change to it, and run

```
	docker-compose up
```

and you should get a redmine instance on localhost:8080 that you can
log into with the username:password admin:admin. Just follow the final
configuration of the redmine git hosting plugin (step 9 Finish
installation) http://redmine-git-hosting.io/get_started/.

Note, I've not yet enabled hooks (see step 5).
